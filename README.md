### Business context

The client is a NetSuite user who wants to construct a monitoring BI ecosystem.
While NetSuite offers some reporting capabilities, the client is limited because :
- Some transformations are impossible to do in NetSuite (e.g. perform several joins throughout the model)
- Some external data should be integrated (mostly Excel files in this project)
...

The first use case identified by the client is a monitoring of the Sales pipeline, taking into account invoices, sales orders and opportunities.
